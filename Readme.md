   - You can right-click the Docker icon in the system tray and select "Dashboard" to see the Docker Desktop interface.


### Application Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ncbateman/weather
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Application Directory**

   ```bash
   cd weather
   ```

## Usage

The application can be built, run, and tested using the provided Bash or PowerShell scripts, depending on your operating system.

### Build Script

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   - **For Ubuntu 20.04:**
     Use the `build.sh` script to build the Docker image for the application.

     ```bash
     sh ./scripts/bash/build.sh
     ```

   - **For Windows:**
     Use the `build.ps1` script to build the Docker image for the application.

     ```powershell
     ./scripts/powershell/build.ps1
     ```

   This will create a Docker image with all necessary dependencies installed.

### Run Script

1. **Run the Application**

   - **For Ubuntu 20.04:**
     Use the `run.sh` script to start the application in a Docker container.

     ```bash
     sh ./scripts/bash/run.sh
     ```

   - **For Windows:**
     Use the `run.ps1` script to start the application in a Docker container.

     ```powershell
     ./scripts/powershell/run.ps1
     ```

   This will start the Flask application inside a Docker container. The API will be accessible at `localhost:8080`.

### Test Script

1. **Run Tests**

   - **For Ubuntu 20.04:**
     Use the `test.sh` script to execute the tests for the application.

     ```bash
     sh ./scripts/bash/test.sh
     ```

   - **For Windows:**
     Use the `test.ps1` script to execute the tests for the application.

     ```powershell
     ./scripts/powershell/test.ps1
     ```

   This will run the unit tests in a Docker container and display the test results.

## API Usage

After running the application, the following endpoints will be available:

- `GET /ping/`: A health check endpoint that returns the status of the application.
- `GET /forecast/<city_name>/?at=<ISO-8061 datetime>`: Fetches weather data for the specified city. The optional `at` parameter can be used to retrieve weather information at a specific time (in ISO-8601 format).

## Basic Authentication

The API endpoint `forecast` is secured with Basic Authentication. Use the following credentials for access:

```
Username: admin
Password: secret
```

For example, when using curl to access an endpoint:

```
curl -u admin:secret http://localhost:8080/forecast/london/
```
